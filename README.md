# tiny-fantasy-maps
A [tiny-islands-like](https://dr-d-king.itch.io/tiny-islands) made as a submission for [Confounding Calendar 2024](https://confoundingcalendar.itch.io/)

Run by cloning, installing the dependencies via `npm install` and then starting the server via `npm run start` with a newish version of node (I was using v22 but that's probably overkill). It should open up a localhost:3000 tab in your default browser.

Once I get github actions to work nicely, you'll be able to play the latest deployed version (auto-deployed every version bump) at https://anvilfood.itch.io/tiny-fantasy-maps

There are all sorts of additional pieces that I'd like to get to:

- Animations (as an excuse to relearn react-spring) to make scoring more intuitive
- Additional design for the interludes between rounds of 9 tiles
- Art for the tiles rather than relying on emoji
- Better tutorialization for people who haven't played tiny islands before
- Daily shuffle and/or random seed selection implementation
